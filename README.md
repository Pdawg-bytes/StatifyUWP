<p align=center>Here's your Spotify companion on Windows! Check all your stats easily and quickly.</p>

## IMPORTANT
This app is a hobby project, so it can't the accepted by Spotify. Use your own client ID or DM me on Discord @shef3r so that I can add you to authorized users (so that you can use the pre-built app). 

### Installation
#### Prebuilt
- Go to the Releases tab and download both the `.msixbundle` nad `.cer` files.
- Make sure you have App Installer on your machine (Alternative methods of installation or "debloated" machines are not supported.)
- Open the `.cer` file, install in for either all users and choose "Trusted people" as the certificate store (manually!)
- Open and `.msixbundle` file with App Installer and click "Install"
- Done!
#### From source
- Open the repo in Visual Studio (in my case, 2022 Community)
    - make sure you have the UWP workload and Windows 11 10.0.22621.0 SDK installed.
- Click F5 or choose "Local Machine" in the options on top.
- Done!

### Contributions
I allow bugfixes as PRs with no problem, but if you want to add a feature, create an issue.
